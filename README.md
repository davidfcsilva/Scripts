## Synopsis

<<<<<<< HEAD
At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
=======
The project will help to concentrate all the knowledge on Powershell. Using this method I'm also allowed to do revision of my own scripts and to also share within the community. The spectrum of those scripts are VMware Vsphere and Cisco UCS.

## Motivation

The reason behind this was to first, get use to the version control for my own scripts, second it's a way to share with other people the work that I have achieved and could also be of use for others with similar requirements.

## Installation

Depends on the requirements, but for a start you will need Powershell v3, PowerCli for VMware and Cisco UCS snapins for Cisco UCS.

## Tests

Each script will have it's own testing method.

## Contributors

Majority of the work was done by myself, some cases I had to use references from online scripts in order to achieve what I wanted.
On the Cisco UCS report it's all Cisco work, I'm just holding this version for future reference.
