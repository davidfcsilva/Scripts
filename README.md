## Synopsis

The project will help to concentrate all the knowledge on Powershell. Using this method I'm also allowed to do revision of my own scripts and to also share within the community. The spectrum of those scripts are VMware Vsphere and Cisco UCS.

## Motivation

The reason behind this was to first, get use to the version control for my own scripts, second it's a way to share with other people the work that I have achieved and could also be of use for others with similar requirements.

## Installation

Depends on the requirements, but for a start you will need Powershell v3, PowerCli for VMware and Cisco UCS snapins for Cisco UCS.

## Tests

Each script will have it's own testing method.

## Contributors

Majority of the work was done by myself, some cases I had to use references from online scripts in order to achieve what I wanted.
On the Cisco UCS report it's all Cisco work, I'm just holding this version for future reference.
